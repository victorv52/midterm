Components I've used:
ADXL 335 Accelerometer
Arduino Uno
Breadboard

Description:
Whenever the breadboard is tilted at a certain angle, 
the sound emits a different frequency.

There were a few problems at first when i figured out what kind of project
that I wanted to do, so I figured I would use it in the simplest way possible.
I used the laptop speaker instead of the speaker that would often connect to
the breadboard to make sound. I wanted to add additional iteractivity to the
project, but I had no time and what I had was interactive enough. I chose
this project not only because it was simple, but most people wouldn't
think of it as their project. The simpler, the better. It still caught
people's eyes even though I hadn't had anything else to show. It was a fun
thing to make as well as a learning experience.
